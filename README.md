Notes to the Grader:
- Page 8
    - In box 1, I still make a similar shape which I did in pervious workbook because I think this shape is good for praticing `bezierCurveTo`
- Train
    - For the required part:
        - I successfully connect the given points with bezier curves, and those curves will also be connected when add or remove any points
        - I draw the `train` and it can move along the curve; when drag any point, or add / removing any ponits, it will be still on the curve
        - Calculating the tangent lines and get the correct angles to rotate, the train moves with the correct direction, and there is a "yellow light" pointing to the front of movement
    - For any bouns parts:
        - I tried to do the arc-length parameterization and it looks working well: when check the box `arc-length` the trains will move with a constant speed. Also, when dragging / adding / or removing any points, the trains still move with constant speed on the remaining curves
        - I tried to draw trails on the curve, which are currectly placed vertical to the curve.
